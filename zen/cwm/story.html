      <p align="justify">During times of war, many horrible things happen.&nbsp;
      With the recent trend of arms acceleration and biological warfare as well
      as the ongoing threat of nuclear weaponry, we as a species must be
      careful.&nbsp; War has never been a very successful problem solver, but
      now there is the real danger of widespread genocide, accidental or
      otherwise.&nbsp; We must strive for alternate means of dispute
      settlement.&nbsp; Come what may, nothing is worth the potential carnage
      that could come about as a result of human carelessness.</p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Art Barnes looked around
      him.&nbsp; There wasn't much to see, besides a mist of rain coming down in
      strong steady sheets through the trees.&nbsp; He had his eyes open wide
      for VC, but of course, he didn't see any.&nbsp; Suddenly, through the
      dark, what seemed like only very heavy raindrops by the sound came ripping
      through the leaves.&nbsp; Art hit the ground fast, and he quickly felt
      water beginning to seep even deeper into his shirt.&nbsp; He knew that he
      had to get out fast, because the general procedure they had taken to
      lately was simply retreating and firebombing the entire area, and several
      men had already died.&nbsp; The VC moved fast, so you had to retreat
      quickly enough to be able to carpetbomb the area, and if a few men got
      left behind, it was a noble sacrifice to kill nobody ever knew how many of
      the enemy.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Art felt every inch of his skin as
      adrenaline flowed strongly, and he quickly got to his feet, crouching down
      amongst the brush.&nbsp; He heard a few other soldiers running through the
      brush around him, scattered shouts, and bullets shredding the foliage, but
      all he could focus on was the rain in the trees, and the pounding of his
      heart in his ear.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he began to climb a hill, he felt
      something snap into the back of his right thigh.&nbsp; He fell, and warmth
      quickly began to spread across the back of his leg.&nbsp; Before he could
      do anything other than panic, his hand was being pulled, and next thing he
      knew, he was draped over a pair of shoulders.&nbsp; The bouncing run only
      made the pain in his leg worse, but now he was hearing distant thundering
      reports, which meant that the planes were closing in.&nbsp; They were
      probably only a few miles away.&nbsp; When he could hold his head steadily
      up, Art could see two other men running ahead of him, and he actually
      watched one of them get hit in the back of the neck and fall.&nbsp;
      Whoever was carrying him ran right by as Art watched the body spasm on the
      ground.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then the bombing was becoming
      exponentially louder, and then there was a blast of heat and noise from
      directly behind, and Art felt the body beneath him lurch, and then he was
      flying through the air.</p>

      <p align="justify">Tracks of special interest:</p>
      <p align="justify">3. One day, Pat told me about a piano board that was
      resting on his back porch.&nbsp; His father had asked him to bring it to
      the junkyard, but I asked him to bring it over to my place instead.&nbsp;
      After much struggle, I had it in my barn.&nbsp; I went out and bought a
      few mallets, I borrowed Zach's four-track, and I invited Alex over to help
      me make some interesting noise.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there was a
      low-pressure system moving in, and by the time we had set up, it was
      heavily raining, but the rain actually improved things.&nbsp; As the storm
      raged on, we banged away at the piano board.&nbsp; Every few minutes, a
      string would snap with a spark and recoil closely past our faces.&nbsp;
      Eventually we had to stop because we were scaring the horses, but we had
      something.</p>
      <p align="justify">6. One night, Alex and I were touring about the
      countryside, listening to 1050 AM.&nbsp; After a very short while, we
      noticed different stations phasing in and out.&nbsp; AM is a much farther
      reaching wave than FM and on a clear enough day, someone in New York can
      receive transmissions from places as far away as Florida.&nbsp; The AM
      Radio Experiment can be thought of as listening in to God's mind.&nbsp;
      Spinoza philosophized that all that exists is the same one substance, and
      he calls this God, so after a fashion, what Alex and I were experiencing
      was in fact a very limited sampling of God and his thoughts.</p>
      <p align="justify">15. Spontaneous Human Combustion was a planned track,
      but most of the samples in the second half of the track are completely
      spontaneous.&nbsp; I was at Cuppers after hours with many friends, and it
      just started.&nbsp; Everyone went wild, each doing their own thing, mostly
      unrelated.&nbsp; Noise, certain words, transmogrifying into other words,
      plays spontaneously acted out, insanity in group form.&nbsp; So I got out
      my tape recorder and began recording.</p>
      <p align="justify">Other notes:<br>
      <br>
      The drips in spelunking are one of salesman Eric Dudley's knives.&nbsp;
      Yup.</p>
      <p align="justify">If you like Espionage Technologies, check out Auto-Schwitz.</p>
      <p align="justify">The Fifth Symphony burst in Culture Exposure actually
      happened while Alex and I were driving around.&nbsp; Just the first two
      phrases.&nbsp; I swear.</p>
      <p align="justify">The title Liberty Bell is ironic.&nbsp; Duh.&nbsp; So
      is A Patriotic March.</p>
